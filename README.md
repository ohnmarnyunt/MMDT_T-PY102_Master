# PY102: Data Structure
This repo includes the assignments and lectures conducted in the PY102: Data Structure course. This course focuses on the organization, storage, and management of data within computer programs. Students will explore fundamental data structures such as lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.

I believe that hands-on learning is crucial for understanding and thus, the explanations in videos are accompanied by detailed ’Python code’ snippets throughout the text. The readers can follow the structions and run the code in this Repo on their own computer or an online platform such as Google Colab.
